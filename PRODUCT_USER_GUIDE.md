Getting started

The HR App is a web application used by HR and employees to manage employee profiles and leave requests.

If you were given a link to the app, open it in your web browser. The app works best in modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).

Important: Your employee record must be created by HR before you can sign up. If HR has not created your record, you will not be able to sign up or log in.

Signing up and logging in

- Sign up
  1. Go to the Sign Up page.
  2. Enter the email address HR has on file for you.
  3. Choose a password and confirm it.
  4. Click "Sign Up".
  5. If your employee record is present and not already signed up, you will be created and automatically logged in.

- Log in
  1. Go to the Login page.
  2. Enter your email and password.
  3. Click "Login".

If you cannot sign up or log in, contact HR to confirm they added your record and that the email they entered matches the one you are using.

Employee user flows

  1. After logging in, navigate to your dashboard.

  4. Save changes when finished.

- Create a leave request

  3. Submit the request. It will appear in your list of requests.

  2. You can see request status (Pending, Approved, Rejected) and details.

HR user flows

- Add a new employee
  1. Log in using your HR account and go to the HR Dashboard.
  2. Click "Add Employee".
  3. Fill in first name, last name, email, department, and other required fields.

Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

Q: I can't sign up. What should I do?
A: Confirm that HR has created an employee record with your email address. If they have, make sure you're using that exact email when signing up.

Q: I forgot my password.
A: This demo app may not include a password recovery flow. Contact HR or your admin to reset your password in the system.

Q: Are my passwords secure?
A: This project is a demo and may store passwords in plain text for development. Do not use production passwords or sensitive information. In production, always use a secure authentication backend.

Troubleshooting and support

- If pages fail to load or the app can't connect to the server, check your network connection or contact your IT/HR team.
- If data is missing or incorrect, contact HR so they can correct the employee record.

Support contact

If you're still stuck, contact your HR or IT department with the following information:
- Your full name
- Your email address
- A description of the issue and any error messages you see
